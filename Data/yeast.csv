Medium to high attenuation Non-flocculent strain; some settling can be promoted by cooling and use of fining agents and isinglass. Estery to both palate and nose with typical banana notes. Best used at traditional ale temperatures. Optimum temp: 55°-66° F.

It is known to be a quick fermenter, primary fermentation usually being complete in a matter of a few days. All of the characteristics of a good ale yeast are found in Nottingham: a clean flavor profile that allows a great balance between malt and hop character, high, fast flocculation, relatively high attenuation, and low production of fruity esters. This strain can be used to create almost any beer style, and often is used as a house strain by brewers in the know. Because it has a wide temperature range that dips down into the 50s, it has been used to produce very lager-like beers as well.","American and English pale ales, IPAs, Imperial IPAs, Barleywines, Bitters, Milds, Stouts, Porters, Fruit Beers, Irish Red Ale, Cream Ale, Other Smoked Beer, Russian Imperial Stout, Spice, Herb, or Vegetable Beer, Strong Scotch Ale, Wood-Aged Beer.",
