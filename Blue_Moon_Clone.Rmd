# Brew Log

## September 20, 2020

Brewed 10 gallon batch. Mash temp was a little low at 149 degrees F. Final gravity 1.054.   Boil was a tad aggressive. Back off next time.

# October 11, 2020

Kegged two 5 gallon corny kegs.  Citrus is overwhelming.  Tasted like a mimosa.  Consider decreasing sweet orange peel to 3 oz next time.  No problems with the kegging.
